# GBA Multi Game Menu  GUI

This is a menu program to be run on Game Boy Advance bootleg cartridges which are equipped with a special multi-game
mapper.

Designed to work with lesserkuma's GBA Multi Game Menu.

This application can patch the game with SRAM patch and batteryless patch automatically so no extra operation needed
now. Just select the original ROM (Patched ROMs are ok. In most cases it won't be patched again.) in the GUI and
everything would be done.
